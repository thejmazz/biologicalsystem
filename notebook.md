# Notebook
## 2015/12/18
- Ported content from student wiki to GitHub
- Took notes on tasks of assignment
- Read into the [OBO 1.2 format][obo-format]

Mused with the idea of using [GraphQL][GraphQL] for an API that produces ontologies. Imagine this:

```
{
  ontology(id: "GO:0000001") {
    id,
    name,
    namespace,
    def,
    synonym,
    is_a
  }
}
```

which could return JSON like this:

```json
{
  "ontology": {
    "id": "GO:0000001",
    "name": "mitochondrion inheritance",
    "namespace": "biological_process",
    "def": "'The distribution of mitochondria, including the mitochondrial genome, into daughter cells after mitosis or meiosis, mediated by interactions between mitochondria and the cytoskeleton.' [GOC:mcc, PMID:10873824, PMID:11389764]",
    "synonym": "'mitochondrial inheritance' EXACT []",
    "is_a": [
      "GO:0048308 ! organelle inheritance",
      "GO:0048311 ! mitochondrion distribution"
    ]
  }
}
```

The advantage being here that this only requires **one server endpoint** and **one request** for composited data. The query determines what is returned. Consider the "legacy" technique: `api.com/endpoint/ontology/GO:0000001?name=t&def=t` or a similar POST body. This requires extensive modification and implementation  server-side to handle all these cases. Furthermore, the query could be expanded to include other data formats. Imagine a large scale "BioGraphQL" project backed by NCBI, ENSEMBLE, PDB, _etc._ We could have every bio database accessible from a single API, using a descriptive query language! Each data type could get its own "namespace", `ontology`, or `pdb` for example. Relations between data types could be strictly defined. Issue: how to organize/fund the unification of all these databases and organizations.

In the context of this project, it would be nice to have GraphQL queries to retrieve relationships between ontologies, genes associated with an ontology, properties of those genes such as CTD, PDB xrefs, _etc._ See the [GraphQL Working Draft][graphql-draft] for specifics.

**Plans for next day**

As tempting as it is to code new tools (QuickGO could be a bit more interactive...would be nice to expand out children/details within the same DAG view), I should get on with using what's available and garnering some data. At this point I have one root term: [mitochondrion localization][GO:0051646]. Thus, I will  attempt to define a group of genes responsible for (getting) the mitochondria (where they need to be) - are they already there? Do we just want to maintain their current position? Ultimately I'd like to answer all those questions with curated gene sets. If "mitochondria" as a whole becomes too unwieldy, I will limit to a defined subsystem, perhaps one of the three children of our root:
- [GO:0051659][GO:0051659] (maintenance of mitochondrion localization)
- [GO:0051654][GO:0051654] (establishment of mitochondrion localization)
- [GO:0048311][GO:0048311] (mitochondrion distribution)

So, tomorrow I plan on going through each of these terms and their children (9 total), and finding (5-10?) representative genes for each term. Human when possible.

## 2015/12/19
Did readings. Started working on [bionode-obo](https://github.com/thejmazz/bionode-obo).

### Localization of mitochondria in living cells with rhodamine
This paper from 1979 described a new technique to isolate the visualization of mitochondrion in a variety of cell types using rhodamin 123.
- mitochondria are plastic, mobile, and express morphological heterogeneity
- morphology influence by metabolic state, cell cycle, development,
- differentiation, pathological states
- movement can be observed in a 15-30s timeframe
- varying morphologies:
  - large, globular in rat cardiac muscle
  - filamentous radiating from perinuclear in marsupial kidney
  - interconnecting network in mouse 3T6 cell

- colchicine distorts shape and dist. of mitochondria, "probably by affecting
- the depolymerization of microtubules"
- crossbridges observed b/w microtubules and mitochondria

### Miro1 Is a Calcium Sensor for Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Localization of Mitochondria at Synapses
This paper explored the biochemical processes observed during ion fluctuation in neurons.
- Miro: Mitochondial Rho GTPase
- mitochondrial trafficking regulated by Ca2+ entry
- Miro1 **links** mitochondria to KIF5 **motor proteins**
  - linkage inhibited by Ca2+ binding to Miro1's EF domains

- "Miro1 is a key determinant of how energy supply is matched to energy use in
- neurons"
- mitochondria need to be close to sites of ion fluxes since most brain ATP
- generated by mitochondria
- "Mutations in proteins regulating mitochondrial dynamics compromise synaptic
- function and plasticity"
- trafficking mediated by kinesins
- syntabulin and syntaphilin proposed as linking machineray
- GTPases Drp1, OPA1, Mitofusins regulate dist. of neuronal mitochondria
- Miro has TM domain locating them to outer mitochondrial membrane, two
- GTPase domains, two Ca2+ sensing EF hand domains protruding into cytoplasm
- "calcium influx ... causes mitochondria to accumulate at synapses in a
- Miro1-dependent manner"
- changing Miro1 expressions does not change speed of moving mitochondria
- EF hand domain mutant facilitated mitochondrial movement to same extent as WT
- Milton in _drosophilia_ has mitochondria binding site, closest homolog
- GRIF-1/TRAK2
- syntabullin, RanBP2
- **functional role** during neuronal activity: locate mitochondrion near
- postsynaptic membrane where they are needed to provide calcium buffering and
- to provide ATP to pump out ions that enter through synaptic channels

## 2015/12/20
Continued some work on bionode-obo parser. Studying for linear algebra exam.

## 2015/19/21
More studying and exam.

## 2015/19/22
- went through notebook, notes on papers
- observed QuickGO "protein annotation tab". Can't handle not working
- programmatically - thankfully QuickGO provides
- [REST web services][quickgo-rest]
- Made [bionode-quickgo][bionode-quickgo] to scratch my itch. Can now use
- QuickGO API with semantic ease through a Promise or Stream
- Small gasket pipeline which gets tsv of a given go term from quickgo, converts
- it to csv
- gasket pipeline imports and exports from dat
- exported dataset gets filtered by protein ids, 347 results down to 304 proteins
- these 33 extra results seem to be all from proteins with more than one ref, most
- have 2, some have 3
- sorting by number of refs, I retrieved `Q7TSA0`, `Q8BG51`, and `Q8BG51` as the
- top three for [GO:0047497][GO:0047497]. I also notice the first two letters of
- each ID appear to form a "prefix" of sorts - perhaps it best to filter by these
- as well.

### [GO:0047497][GO:0047497] mitochondrion transport along microtubule

## 2015/19/23
- Observed that the first 20 or so, when checking manually by copy pasting
- from an array of IDs arranged by most-refs to least-refs, where all the
- Rot2 gene (with the exception of Rot1 also present in _mus musculus_)
- They are all the same gene!(?)
- So, using the Uniprot URI "api" and [xml2js][xml2js] and [hihat][hihat] I
- began inspecting from where to retrieve the "name" attribute:

![hihat01](img/hihat.png)
- finally got xml parsing pipeline to output "name" of gene. Would be nice
- to post-process the xmlJSON output to convert single-length arrays to
- their object..was frustrating parsing this data

```js
xmlJSON.uniprot.entry[0].gene[0].name[0]._
```

- Among the names I see RHOT2, KIF1B, MAP1B, MAPT, Miro, RHOT1, ... just
- need to remove duplicates
- filters into arrays by gene name. but pipe ends here and need to refactor
- into smaller pipeables
- sorts by size of array:

![filtered-sorted](img/filtered-sorted.png)

Generated [markdown files](https://github.com/thejmazz/biologicalsystem/tree/master/files) by running gasket pipeline with different GO IDs.

Some GO terms have no protein annotations!

Noted down "popular genes" from each markdown dump.

**MAPT**

Microtubule-associated protein tau

Human: [P10636](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636)
- Promotes microtubule assembly and stability, and might be involved in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity. The C-terminus binds axonal microtubules while the N-terminus binds neural plasma membrane components, suggesting that tau functions as a linker protein between both. Axonal polarity is predetermined by TAU/MAPT localization (in the neuronal cell) in the domain of the cell body defined by the centrosome. The short isoforms allow plasticity of the cytoskeleton whereas the longer isoforms may preferentially play a role in its stabilization. [UNIPROT]
- in a lot of biological processes

Human: [P46821](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P46821)
- Facilitates tyrosination of alpha-tubulin in **neuronal** microtubules (By similarity). Phosphorylated MAP1B may play a role in the cytoskeletal changes that accompany neurite extension. Possibly MAP1B binds to at least two tubulin subunits in the polymer, and this bridging of subunits might be involved in nucleating microtubule polymerization and in stabilizing microtubules. Acts as a positive cofactor in DAPK1-mediated autophagic vesicle formation and membrane blebbing [UNIPROT]
- cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, synapse, dendritic spine
- 3 different light chains, LC1, LC2 and LC3, can associate with MAP1A and MAP1B proteins. LC1 interacts with the amino-terminal region of MAP1B. Interacts with ANP32A and TIAM2. Interacts with the tubulin tyrosine TTL (By similarity). Interacts (via C-terminus) with GAN (via Kelch domains). Interacts (via N-terminus) with DAPK1. Interacts with TMEM185A. Interacts with MAP1LC3B

Yeast: [P18409](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P18409)
- Component of the ERMES/MDM complex, which serves as a molecular tether to connect the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Components of this complex are involved in the control of mitochondrial shape and protein biogenesis and may function in phospholipid exchange. MDM10 is involved in the late assembly steps of the general translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM complex). Functions in the TOM40-specific route of the assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins, including the association of TOM40 with the receptor TOM22 and small TOM proteins. Can associate with the SAM(core) complex as well as the MDM12-MMM1 complex, both involved in late steps of the major beta-barrel assembly pathway, that is responsible for biogenesis of all outer membrane beta-barrel proteins. May act as a switch that shuttles between both complexes and channels precursor proteins into the TOM40-specific pathway. Plays a role in mitochondrial morphology and in the inheritance of mitochondria [UNIPROT]
- Component of the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) or MDM complex, composed of MMM1, MDM10, MDM12 and MDM34. Associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting assembly machinery SAM(core) complex, which consists of SAM35, SAM37 and SAM50, to form a SAM(holo) complex.

Next steps will be to assign roles and create functional connections between these genes. Two interesting specific systems could be
- mitochondrial localization in neurons
- mitochondrial localization during cell division
- as genes from both of these specific systems have been found thus far.

Began by annotating the above with more details, filtering some out, retrieved
from original notes and via further inspection (and added notes for new ones).

As well, along the way, I decided to filter more preferentially based on
relevance to mitochondrion dist. in neurons. Though, still including other
genes which appear important for "mitochondria".

**MGARP**

Plays a role in the trafficking of mitochondria along microtubules. Regulates
the kinesin-mediated axonal transport of mitochondria to nerve terminals along
microtubules during hypoxia. Participates in the translocation of TRAK2/GRIF1
from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion. Also plays a role in steroidogenesis
through maintenance of mitochondrial abundance and morphology (By similarity)

**TRAK1**

Involved in the regulation of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking, including
endocytic trafficking of EGF-EGFR complexes and GABA-A receptors.

High expression in spinal cord. ([Zhang, 2009][zhang2009])

[zhang2009]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2008.09.031

Discovered new GO term: [axon transport of mitochondrion](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0019896)

**TIAM2**

Modulates the activity of RHO-like proteins and connects extracellular signals
to cytoskeletal activities. Acts as a GDP-dissociation stimulator protein that
stimulates the GDP-GTP exchange activity of RHO-like GTPases and activates them.
Mediates extracellular laminin signals to activate Rac1, contributing to neurite
growth. Involved in lamellipodial formation and advancement of the growth cone
of embryonic hippocampal neurons. Promotes migration of neurons in the cerebral
cortex. When overexpressed, induces membrane ruffling accompanied by the
accumulation of actin filaments along the altered plasma membrane (By
similarity). Activates specifically RAC1, but not CDC42 and RHOA [UNIPROT]

### Papers Notes

__Atypical Rho GTPases Have Roles in Mitochondrial Homeostasis and Apoptosis*__
_Åsa Fransson, Aino Ruusala, and Pontus Aspenstrom, 2002._

- Miro-1/2 atypical: tandem GTP binding domains separated by a linker region containing EF hand motifs
- present in mitochondria by immunolocalization
- overexpression -> mitochondrial network aggregation, increased apoptotic rate

__The GTPase dMiro Is Required for Axonal Transport of Mitochondria to Drosophila Synapses__
_Xiufang Guo,1,6,7 Greg T. Macleod,1,5,7
Andrea Wellington,1 Fangle Hu,1,3
Sarvari Panchumarthi,1,3 Miriam Schoenfield,1,4 Leo Marin,5 Milton P. Charlton,5
Harold L. Atwood,5 and Konrad E. Zinsmaier, 2005_

- mitochondria in mutants accumulate in parallel rows in neuronal somata
- gain of function causes abnormal accumulation in distal synaptic boutons of neuromascular junctions

__The atypical Rho GTPases Miro-1 and Miro-2 have essential roles in mitochondrial trafficking__
_Åsa Fransson, Aino Ruusala, and Pontus Aspenstrom, 2006._

- Miro GTPase has C-term TM domain -> targeting to mitochondria
- "clustering of mitochondria" from last paper, two distinct phenotypes:
  - aggregated mitochondria (requires GTPase, but not EF hands)
  - thread-like mitochondria (probably defects in trafficking)
- Miro1 interactions with kinesin-binding proteins __GRIF-1__ and __OIP106__
- suggests Miro GTPases form link b/w mitochondria and trafficking apparatus

__GTPase dependent recruitment of Grif-1 by Miro1 regulates mitochondrial trafficking in hippocampal neurons__
_Andrew F. MacAskill a, Kieran Brickley b, F. Anne Stephenson b, Josef T. Kittler, 2008_

- local cellular energy demands, buffering intracellular calcium
- kinesin -> mitochondrial trafficking has been demostrated (src?)
- kinesin adapter Grif-1
- "protein trafficking complex" Grif-1+Miro1 detected in mammalian brain, localised to neuronal mitochondria
- Miro1 expression++ -> recruits Grif-1 to mitochondria

__The Miro GTPases: At the heart of the mitochondrial transport machinery__
_Katarina Reis, Åsa Fransson, and Pontus Aspenstrom, 2009._

- Miro GTPases essential regulators of mitochondrial morphogenesis and trafficking
- Ca2+ dep. sensors
- diseases caused by deregulated mitochondrial dynamics

__Serum- and Glucocorticoid-Inducible Kinase 1 (SGK1) Increases Neurite Formation through Microtubule Depolymerization by SGK1 and by SGK1 Phosphorylation of tau__
_Ying C. Yang,1 Cheng H. Lin,2 and Eminy H. Y. Lee1, 2006._

* SGK1 depolymerizes MTs, indirectly depolymerized MTs through phosphorylation of tau at Ser214
